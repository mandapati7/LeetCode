# LeetCode - Implementation .

Trying to solve at least one Leetcode problem every day.

## Problem 1 [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)


a. I did jumped into the solution and went with the O(n^2).
   Which is not at all optimal solution, I figure it out when I check others solution. 

b. You can find my solution under the mysolution package [here](https://github.com/mandapati7/LeetCode/tree/main/src/main/java/leetcode/day1/twosum/my/solution). 

c. Lessons learned -> Relax, take sometime and try to find out alternative solution, it need not be an optimal.

d. Time is O(n^2) and space is O(1)

## Added two other solutions and linked below.

a. Not an optimal solution, it still goes with O(n^2) and space O(1), find the solution [here](https://github.com/mandapati7/LeetCode/tree/main/src/main/java/leetcode/day1/twosum/other/solution).

b. Optimal solution, used hashmap to store numberToFind variable and goes with time O(n) and space O(n), in this solution we are comprising on space instead of O(1) as in other two solutions.
   Please find the solution [here](https://github.com/mandapati7/LeetCode/tree/main/src/main/java/leetcode/day1/twosum/optimal/solution).
